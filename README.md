# fcc-react-starter
A very simple starter for React for FreeCodeCampers

------------------------------
#Directions
---------------
Just copy and paste the following
`git clone https://github.com/terakilobyte/fcc-react-starter && cd fcc-react-starter && npm install`

After this finishes just run `npm start` and a browser window should open with output from the application. Any changes you make to
the source code will be reflected almost instantly. Any errors you introduce will be displayed too!

#Useful information
---------------
This starter kit is heavily influenced by Cory House's excellent starter kit. The main entry point for the application is
`src/index.js`.

For now, there's only a single component in the `components/` folder, called `App.js`. It simply returns some JSX and the text Hello World.

Feel free to use sass (scss) or css for styling.
